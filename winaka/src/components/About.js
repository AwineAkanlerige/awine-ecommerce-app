Participation in esteemed organizations like the Ghana Export Promotion Council propelled the company onto national and international stages, showcasing its diverse offerings at prestigious exhibitions. Specializing in handwoven straw baskets, Paku Company also exports shea butter, African black soap, Fugu fabric products, and leather goods.
